AAFAutoRebuild
==============

AAFAutoRebuild is rails plugin, that automatically rebuilds your Ferret index if field definitions have changed. 
Its main purpose is to reduce deploy time by only rebuilding parts of your index. 

The plugin only works in conjunction with acts_as_ferret.


Setup & Usage
=============

To install the plugin (Rails >= 2.1):
./script/plugin install git://github.com/rubyphunk/aafautorebuild.git

If you are on older rails you can 'git clone' the repository.

After installing the plugin your new and shiny task
'rake ferret:index:auto_rebuild' should be available.

The plugin works out of the box without configuration, but if you want to use it in your deployment setup you should set the APPLICATION_NAME constant in your environment.rb. This is necessary because AAFAutoRebuild keeps your acts_as_ferret configuration state based on the directory your application is living in, unless APPLICATION_NAME is available. So if your app is deployed to changing release directories the plugin will never be able to restore your last Ferret state.
